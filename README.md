# Thermoelastic topology optimization code for 2D problems in Matlab
Thermoelastic topology optimization procedure considering steady-state and transient heat conduction in Matlab

The file top_tml_shc.m solves a topology optimization problem for a simply-supported beam subjected to a mechanical point load on the top and a thermal boundary condition on the bottom edge. More information about the theory and implementation can be found in:
"Compliance-based topology optimization of structural components subjected to thermo-mechanical loading"
